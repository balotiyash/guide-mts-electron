# Invoice Browser Printing Implementation

## Overview
The invoice printing system has been updated to display invoice previews in the user's default browser instead of using Electron's built-in print dialog. This provides a better user experience with familiar browser printing controls.

## New Features

### 1. Browser-Based Invoice Preview
- Invoices now open as standalone HTML files in the default browser
- Users can preview the invoice before printing
- Familiar browser print controls and options
- Better print preview with proper scaling and margins

### 2. Updated Invoice Service Functions

#### `openInvoiceInBrowser(invoiceData)`
- Generates a standalone HTML file with embedded invoice data
- Converts relative asset paths to absolute file:// URLs
- Adds a convenient "Print Invoice" button for quick printing
- Opens the invoice in the user's default browser

#### `generateStandaloneInvoiceHTML(invoiceData)`
- Creates self-contained HTML with all assets resolved
- Embeds invoice data directly in the HTML
- Includes print-optimized CSS styles
- Adds interactive print button for convenience

### 3. Enhanced User Interface

#### Updated Button Labels
- "Print Original" → "Preview & Print Original"
- "Print Duplicate" → "Preview & Print Duplicate"

#### Improved User Feedback
- Success dialogs inform users that invoice opened in browser
- Clear error messages for any issues
- Instructions guide users to print from browser

### 4. New CSS Print Styles (`invoice-print.css`)
- Print button hidden during actual printing
- Optimized print layout and margins
- Proper page break handling
- Responsive screen and print media queries

## API Changes

### New IPC Handler
- `open-invoice-in-browser`: Opens invoice in default browser

### Updated Preload API
- `window.invoiceAPI.openInvoiceInBrowser(userId, workId, type)`: Main function for browser-based printing

### Updated Import/Export
- New function exports from `invoiceService.js`
- New utility functions in `printInvoiceUtility.js`

## Usage Flow

1. User clicks "Preview & Print Original" or "Preview & Print Duplicate"
2. System generates standalone HTML file with invoice data
3. HTML file opens in user's default browser
4. User sees invoice preview with "Print Invoice" button
5. User can print using browser's native print functionality
6. Temporary HTML file is automatically cleaned up by system

## Benefits

✅ **Better User Experience**: Familiar browser printing interface
✅ **Print Preview**: Users can see exactly how the invoice will print
✅ **More Control**: Access to all browser printing options (page setup, printer selection, etc.)
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across different operating systems
✅ **No Modal Blocking**: Non-blocking operation allows continued use of the application
✅ **Self-Contained**: Standalone HTML files work even if the main application is closed

## Backward Compatibility

The original Electron-based printing (`printInvoiceForUser`) is still available for fallback purposes, but the new browser-based approach (`openInvoiceInBrowser`) is now the default method used throughout the application.
